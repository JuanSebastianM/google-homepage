This is a project from The Odin Project's foundations course.
It consists of making a Google search results page clone with HTML and CSS.

This project took me 3 days (10-15 hours in total).

I am proud to say I managed to improve my HTML, CSS and googling skills. This is still the beginning of a great career, I am full of hope.

Thanks for reading this and for taking a look at my development.
